# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

## What is GAN?

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of construct in neural network technology that offers a lot of potential in the world of artificial intelligence. A generative adversarial network is composed of two neural networks: a generative network and a discriminative network, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”).
